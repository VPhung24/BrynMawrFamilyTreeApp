## Protoype Summary

<!--*Describe the basic functionality of your prototype. What are the features you were able to implement? What features would you like to implement?*-->

WTF week, otherwise known as Welcome-The-First-Years-Week, is one of Bryn Mawr's most memorable traditions! It is a weeklong affair of students running around campus completing tasks, strengthening relationships with the upperclassmen, and stopping time just to be young.
The first years, as a ‘rosebud’, first ask an upper classman they have grown close to over the first semester to be their ‘rose’. This is part of the college wide practice of creating ties between different members of the student body. It is essentially a self-maintaining and self-propagating family. Students establish these relationships through bryn-marriages, bryn mothers, bryn daughters, and bryn adoptees. At first not apparent, there is a whole network of relationships that serve to connect the upperclassmen to the lower classmen and the existing student body to the alumni.
Before, to get to know the members of one’s family, one would have to coordinate a dinner to meet each member face to face. This is, for one, can become a hassle when working through conflicting schedules. Another problem that can arise, especially with big families complete with cousins and adoptees, is the task of remembering every single member and their corresponding title. Now, with our website, we have automated the process by creating a way for users to input information to add to the existing database and retrieve information through a search. To complete this project, we familiarized ourselves with the concepts used python, flask, html, and JavaScript to create this system that organizes, categorizes, and stores data for practical and efficient use for both the current student body and for the Bryn Mawr students that are to come.
